## Step 1: Navigate to the AWS Website

* [X] Open a web browser of your choice.

* [X] Type aws.amazon.com into the address bar and press Enter.

    Alternate Option: If you’re not confident about the URL, search for "AWS" in Google
    and click on the link to the official AWS website (aws.amazon.com).

## Step 2: Locate the "Create AWS Account" Button

* [X] On the AWS homepage: Look for the big orange button in the top right corner
  labeled "Sign in to the Console".

* [X] If you're creating an account for the first time, you should see a button
  labeled "Create an AWS Account":

    If this button doesn’t appear, click "Sign in to the Console", then find "Create a
    new AWS account" at the bottom of the page.

## Step 3: Enter Your Account Details

* [X] Click "Create an AWS Account".

* [X] Fill in the following details:

    * Email Address: Enter a valid email address (you'll need access to this email for
      verification).
    * Password: Create a strong password for your AWS account.
    * AWS Account Name: Choose a unique name for your AWS account.

## Step 4: Add Billing Information

* [X] Provide a credit card or debit card for billing purposes:

    * AWS requires a valid payment method, even if you only plan to use free-tier
        services
    * If you don’t have a traditional credit card consider using a prepaid card or
        virtual credit card
    * Example: In Canada, services like Koho offer virtual Visa debit cards that are
        compatible with AWS

* [X] Ensure the card is loaded with sufficient funds if using a prepaid option.

## Step 5: Verify Your Identity

* [X] AWS will ask you to verify your identity through:

    * SMS verification: Provide a phone number and enter the code sent to your device.
    * Email verification: Confirm your email by clicking the link in the verification
        email AWS sends you.

## Step 6: Choose an AWS Support Plan

* [X] Select a support plan:

    Basic Support is free and sufficient for most users starting with AWS.

* [X] Confirm your selection

## Step 7: Complete Account Creation

* [X] After entering all details and completing verification, AWS will create your
  account.

* [X] You can now log in to the AWS Management Console:

    * Go back to the AWS homepage and click "Sign in to the Console".
    * Use the email and password you set up earlier.

## Next Steps

* Once logged in, you'll land on the AWS Management Console.
* Explore services and ensure you're aware of Free Tier Limits to avoid unexpected
charges.
* Congratulations! Your AWS account is ready for use.
