# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

There are three different types of deployment models for Cloud Computing.

* [Cloud](#cloud)
    * [Cloud Deployment](#cloud-deployment)
* [Hybrid](#hybrid)
    * [Hybrid Deployment](#hybrid-deployment)
* [On-Premises](#on-premises)
    * [On-premises(Private cloud) Deployment](#on-premisesprivate-cloud-deployment)
* [Reference](#reference)
* [Multi-cloud](#multi-cloud)

## Cloud

When you think of Cloud, think of small startups.

### Cloud Deployment

100% of IT infrastructure is on the cloud. All of a companies applications were
migrated to or created on the cloud. Helps to remove roadblocks of costly and time
consuming procurement processes for on-premises infrastructure (big servers and data
centers!). Great for small businesses and start-ups.

aka: Cloud-Native or Cloud First

## Hybrid

When you think of Hybrid, think of Fin Tech Companies

### Hybrid Deployment

Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources Great for established
companies that had a dedicated data center but also wants to migrate processes over
to the cloud Data is partially on the cloud, and partially in the on-premises Popular
in the Fin Tech space

## On-Premises

When you think of On-premises, think of large old companies or companies that are
beholden to Government Regulations.

The private cloud could be OpenStack.

### On-premises(Private cloud) Deployment

Use virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premises data centers. Resembles
traditional IT infrastructure with big servers, data centers, etc. Do not get the
same benefits of cloud computing (ability to easily scale up and down on demand)
Company has dedicated resources that are not shared with others(good for security)
Resources cannot be accessed using the internet Typically older large companies or
owned by Government organizations

## Multi-cloud

Using Multiple cloud providers

For example, Using Azure Arc to deploy to both Amazon EKS and GCP Kubernetes Engine.
