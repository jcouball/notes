## Cloud Computing models

There are three main models of Cloud Computing:

1. SaaS - Software as a Service
2. PaaS- Platform as a Service
3. IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service

## SaaS: Software as a Service (Consume)

For Customers

A product that is run and managed by the service provider.

You don't worry about how the service is maintained. It just works and remains
available.

Easy to use and comes complete with a user interface but has the least flexibility.

Examples:

* Gmail
* Adobe Creative Cloud

## PaaS: Platform as a Service (Build)

For Developers.

Focus on the deployment and management of your apps.

You don't worry about, provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or OS.

Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications
without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically
associated with developing and launching an app.

Less flexibility than IaaS because of pre-constructed packages.

Examples:

* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Windows Azure
* Heroku
* Google App Engine

## IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service (Host)

The basic building blocks for cloud IT.

Provides Most basic building blocks of cloud IT infrastructure including networking
features, computers and data storage space.

You don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware.

It has the most flexibility and management control of all the different cloud
computing models. It is the closest to having a traditional on-premises data center.

Examples:

* Amazon Web Services Amazon EC2
* Microsoft Azure Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
* Google Cloud Google Compute Engine
