# Common Cloud Services

A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various
types of services.

The four most common types of cloud services for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
would be:

* **Compute​** - Imagine having a virtual computer that​ can run applications,
  programs, and code.
* **Networking​** - Imagine having a virtual network that allows you to define
  internet connections or network isolations
* **Storage​**- Imagine having a virtual hard drive that​ can store files
* **Databases​** - Imagine a virtual database for storing and reporting data or a
  database for general-purpose web-application

Note: - AWS has over 200+ cloud services

The term “Cloud Computing” can be used to refer to all categories, even though it has
“compute” in the name.
