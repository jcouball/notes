## How You Should Study

* You should do the Journey in order from start to finish and complete it in 1-2
  weeks.
* You should do all the Follow Alongs in your AWS account.
* You should be studying your flashcards every single day you log in.
* You should be writing down notes with a pen on paper.
* You should do 3 practice exams after completing the Journey.
* You should be completing mastery on an exam before starting a new set
* You should do all your flashcards on the day of the exam.
* You should print out and review the Cheatsheets on the day of your exam.

## Warning Signs You Are Going to Fail

### You took more than two weeks to complete your journey content

We have seen that people take multiple weeks to months to complete the journey
content, then fail the exam. The reason is that you need to keep the entire Journey
in your active memory and because they took so long to study, they forget most of
the lecture content. They had false confidence that they could remember everything
they learned when in reality, they forgot because they were not applying that
knowledge.

You should complete your Journey in 1-2 weeks. That means you need to spend 1-2
hours daily.

### You did not do the Follow Alongs in your own Account

We have noticed that when people get to the practice exams, they are overwhelmed at
how much more difficult the practice exams are compared to journey content, and
they score 10% lower on their first practice exam attempt.

Doing the Follow Alongs will help you contextualize how the service works, and you
will indirectly absorb additional information that cannot be covered in our study
notes and videos.

By doing the Follow Alongs, you will better commit both the practical and lecture
knowledge to your memory. Also, most importantly, you'll learn to gain confidence
with AWS.

Keeping our video and step-by-step instructions up-to-date is challenging because
AWS constantly changes daily. You will get stuck during the Follow Alongs but
working through them is part of your Journey.

The AWS console has hundreds of thousands of users, and sometimes the AWS Console
does not react the same, which can throw people off. So you will get stuck where
hundreds have gotten stuck prior, and you'll have to ask us a question, and maybe
you'll see that we have already answered how to debug your problem in great detail,
and that's the knowledge you a missing out on if you don't do the Follow Alongs.

### You waited too long between your last practice exam and the actual exam

We have seen people complete their Journey and score between 80-90% on their last
practice exam and are ready to take it, but they sit the exam 1-2 weeks from their
last practice exam. What ends up happening is they fail just shy of a few
percentages. So it's essential to close the gap between your last practice exam and
the actual exam. This is why I encourage people who score in the 70% range to book
their exam with the intent that they will get their scores up before they sit the
exam.

Also, you should look at what date and times are available to book while you are
doing the practice exams so you can best guess when to take the exam as close as
your last practice exam.

### You didn't use the practice exams system as intended

This is where I see people sabotage their studies the most.

#### Out of Order

It would be best if you only looked at practice exams when you had completed your
Journey. There is a finite number of questions, and you are cheating your brain of
learning when you see them early, and then you see the correct answers. We try to
mitigate this by having 3 variations of each question, but we can only do so much
to mitigate this issue. So only start taking practice exams at the end of your
Journey.

You need to take 3 practice exam sets to close together.

For the CCP, you should take 3 practice exam sets in less than a week. A practice
exam set is 65 questions. So you should experience 195 unique questions. This
will help you pass, so you don't want to lose this information from your active
memory because you spaced them out too far.

I have seen some people take their practice exams months apart and score within
the 80% range on their last exam, which gives them false confidence because they
can't remember the first two practice exam sets.

#### You need to do mastery before you move to your next practice exam set

Our system is designed so that you treat your first attempt on a practice exam
set like an actual exam. Then you proceed to mastery, where you must take the
same practice exam questions again, but only the ones you got wrong. Of course,
it would be best if you kept taking these mastery exams until you answered every
question correctly.

If you move on to your next practice exam set or do your mastery later, you are
leaving points on the table, and you will score lower than expected on your exam.

#### Not treating your first practice exam set attempt like an actual exam

When you attempt a new set of questions, the first attempt is treated like an
actual exam. Unfortunately, some people only do a few questions and then
prematurely end the exam so they can see the answer. So they treat their first
attempt as if it were the mastery system.

### You didn't use the Spaced Repetition Learning Flashcard System

You are adding flashcards to a deck when you progress through the Journey. That
deck is powered by a learning algorithm called Spaced Repetition Learning. It's
designed to prompt you to study flashcards, forgetting them on the cusp of your
memory. This will allow you to remember factoid information long-term. The more
complex the certification, the harder it gets.

If you open the Flashcards Console, you can see there are Study Boxes. Every time
you can remember correctly, the flashcard moves into the next study box, which is
the next time you will see that flashcard. When they reach the final box, you are
supposed to review those flashcards on the day of your exam.

You have to use this system during your entire Journey, and it's the first thing
you should do before you start watching videos, following along, or doing a
practice exam.

### On your third practice exam set attempt, you didn't score between 80-90%

Generally, people will score 48% on the first attempt, 74% on the second attempt,
and the third attempt at 80%. If you don't score in this range, then there is
some deficit in your learning, and you need to reach out to an instructor.

## When you're not sure if you'll pass or not

An instructor who has a 1-on-1 conversation with a student can tell if you're
ready by challenging your knowledge by asking a series of questions and keep
digging to see how well you know the topics. There is no way to cheat an
instructor and could reveal misconceptions or weak points where you need to
supplement knowledge.
