# Case Study Question Type

This is a question type that is included in the practice exam that isn't included in
the real exam.

There is a short paragraph giving a case study followed by single- or multi- choice questions.

A case study is like having a mini-exam within the exam. Once you exit the case study
you can not revisit the questions and answers.
