# Exam guide walkthrough

The most important information for you so you have an idea of what we're trying to
study for.

[AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Exam
Guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-cloud-practitioner/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner_Exam-Guide.pdf)

* [Target candidate](#target-candidate)
* [Domains covered](#domains-covered)
* [What is covered](#what-is-covered)

## Target candidate

Ideal for candidates for non-IT backgrounds.

Out of scope: coding, cloud architeture design, troubleshooting, implementation, load
and performance testing

NO AWS cert will test your coding, diagramming, or performance testing skills.

## Domains covered

AWS certifications cover explain, understand, describe, and identify... aka more
conceptual understanding vs. hands on technical skills.

AWS lists a lot of concepts that might be on the exam, but not all will show up.

We have four domains here.

* Cloud Concepts 28%
* Security 24%
* Technology 36%
* Billing and Pricing 12%

From the class notes:

The largest portion of the exam is Technology at 36% and Billing and Pricing is the
lowest which is funny because I find it to be the most valuable information in the
entire course.

With Cloud Concepts we need to be able to define the AWS Cloud in its proposition, we
need to be able to identify aspects of AWS Cloud Economics and list the different
Cloud Architectural Principles.

For Security you will learn a variety of AWS Security Services and shared
responsibility models.

For Technology you will learn all core AWS Services and other AWS Services and Global
Infrastructures.

Billing and Pricing is how we know how much things cost and how we can save money on
AWS, how to compare and contrast various pricing models for AWS, how to recognize the
various account structures in relation to ASW Billing and Pricing and how to Identify
Resources for Billing Support.

When you do take this exam it has 65 questions and you have both multiple choice and
multiple response. For multiple choice you're going to choose one out of four, or
multiple response where you choose two or more out of five or more options but
generally it's two out of five or three out of six.

I just want to highlight one more thing, which is the white papers. Any time you
study for an exam, AWS always has suggestion's to study these white papers first. At
the CCP level it's not so important because we definitely cover the content here.
When you study for harder exams however, especially the Professionals and
Specialties, you have to read the white papers, but again at this level, it's not so
important.
