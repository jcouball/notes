## Interval

[Intervals](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/intervals/)

An interval in music is defined as a distance in pitch between any two notes.

There are three characteristics of an interval:

* The distance of the interval
* The type of interval (the interval quality)
* Is the interval harmonic or melodic?

### Interval Distance

The smallest possible interval (in western music anyway) is a ***semitone***, or in the
US it’s called a ***half step***. A semitone is the very next higher or lower note.

The word ‘semi’ means half (it’s the same semi that we get semiquaver from which is
‘half’ of a quaver) so we could think of the word semitone as ‘half a tone’.

A ***tone*** or ***whole step***, therefore, is an interval of two semitones.

### Interval Number

We describe intervals using numbers depending on how many letter names of the musical
alphabet there are between the two notes.

e.g. if we look at the notes C and E they are three letter notes apart and so this
interval is a 3rd. C to Eb is also a 3rd.

### Interval Quality

#### perfect

To be a perfect interval the upper note has to be in the major scale of the low note

There are three intervals that are what we call perfect intervals: perfect 4th,
perfect 5th, perfect 8ve

For example C to F# is a 4th but is not a perfect 4th as F# is not in C major scale

#### major

* There are four intervals that are called major intervals:
  * major 2nd, major 3rd, major 6th, and major 7th
* If the upper note of an interval is in the major scale of the lower note (and it’s
  not a 4th, 5th or 8ve) then it will be a major interval.

* augmented
  * An interval becomes augmented when we extend a major or perfect interval by one
    semitone (half step) without changing the letter name.
  * For example, given a major 2nd like F to G, change the G to G# to make an augmented
    2nd.
  * For example, given a perfect 5th like F to C, change the C to C# to make an
    augmented 5th.

* minor
  * Any major interval made smaller by one semitone is a minor interval
  * For example, if we took C to E which is a major 3rd and flattened the E to make it
    an Eb, it now becomes a minor 3rd.
  * Because there are only four major intervals there are also only four minor intervals:
  * minor 2nd, minor 3rd, minor 6th, minor 7th

* diminished
  * Flatten any of the three perfect intervals (the 4th, 5th or 8ve) or any minor
    interval (minor 2nd, minor 3rd, minor 6th, or minor 7th) by a semitone, to make a
    diminished interval.
  * For example, given A and D which is a perfect 4th, flatten the D to Db to make it a
    diminished 4th.
  * For example, given E and D which is a minor 7th, flatten D to Db to make it a
    diminished 7th.

| 12            | Perfect 8ve    | P8               | C – C       |

### Compound Intervals

A ***compound interval*** is any musical interval that is larger than an octave as
opposed a ***simple interval*** which spans less than an octave.

For intervals larger than an octave, just repeat the simple interval adding '7'.

For example, C to E is a major 3d and C to E an octave above is a major 10th.

### Harmonic Intervals

***Harmonic intervals*** are how we describe two notes that are played, at the same time.

### Melodic Intervals

The opposite of a harmonic interval is a ***melodic interval*** which is where the two
notes are played one after the other.

## Scale

[Music Scales Beginners Guide](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/music-scales-beginners-guide/)

A scale is a group of notes that are arranged by ascending or descending order of pitch.

There are many different [musical scales](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/music-scales-beginners-guide/).

Each scale uses a different formula of intervals and has a completely different sound
and feel. Some sound happy, some sound mysterious and some sound sad or melancholy.

### Scale Degree

Each notes in a scale are know as degrees. A scale has 7 degrees named as follows:

* 1st degree: the tonic
* 2nd degree: the supertonic (above the tonic)
* 3rd degree: the mediant (middle of a triad chord, a 3rd ***above*** the tonic)
* 4th degree: the subdominant (a 5th ***below*** the tonic)
* 5th degree: the dominant (a 5th ***above*** the tonic)
* 6th degree: the submediant (a 3rd ***below*** the tonic)
* 7th degree: the leading note (or leading tone)

The natural minor scale is different: the 7th degree of the scale is an interval of a
tone (whole step) below the tonic instead of a semitone (half step) like the leading
note. For this reason a flattened 7th note is called the ***subtonic***.

**Triad Chord**

When building a triad chord we use three notes: the 1st, 3rd and 5th degrees of the scale.

### Major Scale

Major scales are defined by their combination of [semitones and tones](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/intervals/)
(whole steps and half steps):

**Tone** – **Tone** – **Semitone** – **Tone** – **Tone** – **Tone** – **Semitone**

Or in whole steps and half steps it would be:

**Whole** – **Whole** – **Half** – **Whole** – **Whole** – **Whole** – **Half**

### Minor Scales

Minor scales also have seven notes like the major scale but they’re defined by having a
flattened third. This means that the third note is lowered by one semitone or half step.

Unlike the major scales where there is only variation, there are three different minor
scales: natural, harmonic, and melodic.

#### The Natural Minor

A natural minor scale uses this formula of tones and semitones (whole steps and half steps).

**T** – **S** – **T** – **T** – **S** – **T** – **T**

Or in whole steps and half steps it would be:

**W** – **H** – **W** – **W** – **H** – **W** ﻿– **W**

![img](https://hellomusictheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8.8-1024x180.png)

#### The Harmonic Minor

Harmonic minors use this combination of tones and semitones:

**T** – **S** – **T** – **T** – **S** – **T1⁄2** – **S**

Or in whole steps and half steps it would be:

**W** – **H** – **W** – **W** – **H** – **W1⁄2** – **H**

Note that harmonic minors have an interval that is a tone and a half or three semitones.

![img](https://hellomusictheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8.1-1024x180.png)

The harmonic minor is very similar to the natural minor. The only difference is that
the **7th degree of the scale is one semitone higher**.

#### The Melodic Minor

Melodic minor scales are quite different from natural and harmonic minors as they use
different notes when ascending (going up) and descending (going down).

Ascending melodic minors use this combination of tones and semitones:

**T** – **S** – **T** – **T** – **T** – **T** – **S**

Or in whole steps and half steps:

**W** – **H** – **W** – **W** – **W** – **W** – **H**

But on the way down they use this combination (from the top down):

**T** – **T** – **S** – **T** – **T** – **S** – **T**

Or in whole steps and half steps

**W** – **W** – **H** – **W** – **W** – **H** – **W**

A melodic minor ascending is:

When descending the **6th and 7th notes are lowered by one semitone**.

### Diatonic vs. Chromatic Scales

The Major Scale and Minor Scales are [diatonic scales](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/diatonic-scales/).
A **diatonic scale** is a [type of music scale](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/music-scales-beginners-guide/)
with seven notes (also called a [heptonic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptatonic_scale)).

A diatonic scale use all seven pitch letter names (A, B, C, D etc) in sequence without
skipping any.

### Whole Tone Scale

### Pentatonic Scale

### Modes

[Learn Modes](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/modes/)=

Modes, which are sometimes called the church modes, are a series of seven
[musical scales](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/music-scales-beginners-guide/) each
with their own unique qualities and sound.

These seven scales are all types of [diatonic scale](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/diatonic-scales/)
which means they have seven notes and have two intervals that are semitones (half
steps) and five intervals that are tones (whole steps).

There are seven types of modes:

* Ionian mode
* Dorian mode
* Phrygian mode
* Lydian mode
* Mixolydian mode
* Aeolian mode
* Locrian mode

We can also categories these seven modes into two types, **major modes** and
**minor modes**.

Major modes are major because the third note in their scale is a major 3rd above the
tonic and the minor modes are minor as the third note in their scale is a minor third
above the tonic.

The three major modes are: Ionian, Lydian and Mixolydian and the four minor modes are:
Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian and Locrian.

Each mode is formed starting at a different point in the major scale formula:

Ionian is the regular major scale.

Aeolian is the natural minor scale.
