# Introduction

There are my personal notes taken from the excellent Code With Mosh course
[The Complete Node.js Course](https://codewithmosh.com/courses/enrolled/293204).

The course is great. I encourage anyone wanting to learn Node.js to take the
course. You will learn a lot more from taking the course than you will from reading
my notes.

It is well worth the price.
